Only the main branch is actively supported. Older tags and forks do not receive security patches. Always update to the latest commit to receive fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do **not** open public GitHub issues for security problems. Instead:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/matt-e-builds/karpenter-ai-agent/security/advisories/new.
2. Provide a clear description, reproduction steps, and any proof-of-concept you have.
3. Include the environment details (Karpenter AI Agent commit, Python version, OS).

The maintainer (Matt E.) will acknowledge reports within 5 business days and coordinate a fix + disclosure timeline. If you cannot use the advisory form, contact the maintainer via GitHub (https://github.com/matt-e-builds) for alternate encrypted channels.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure.
